Hard-Coded Executable Launcher
==============================

Hard-Coded Executable Launcher is a specialised quick and dirty application to replace the need for a Windows shortcut file. It simply tests whether or not the hardcoded application path exists on the system and if it does, uses ShellExecute to try and launch the hardcoded executable.

The application needs to be recompiled for each different application use.

Created by Craig Lotter, March 2006

Note: This is a specialised application for Commerce I.T. usage.
